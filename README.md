# Zig Code Examples

Repository of Zig code examples that I have cooked up learning Zig.

To run the examples use the following command: `zig run .\src\<filename>.zig`

To run the tests use the following command: `zig test .\src\<filename>.zig`

## Examples

1. fizzbuzz.zig: An example implementation of [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).
2. string_reverse.zig: Reverse a string by iterating half way through and swapping values. Should be able to reverse any string of any length. [Reverse String](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-string-in-c-cpp-different-methods/).
3. guess.zig: A simple number guessing game. You must guess a number between 1 and 100. Uses the current timestamp to seed the random number generator.
